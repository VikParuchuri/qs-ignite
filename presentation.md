## Before we start

* Follow along at vikparuchuri.github.io/qs-ignite

---
= data-x="1000" data-y="1000" data-scale="2"

## The most important question

* I was working really long hours.
* Realized that I was unhappy
* Why am I unhappy, and how can it get better?

---
= data-x="2000" data-y="2000" data-scale="1"

## How do we do that?

* Wanted to measure happiness and mood.
* Track passive data to find correlations.
* Make entries when I want (no fixed time)

---
= data-x="3000" data-y="0" data-scale="1"

## What can we use?

* Evaluated lots of measurement tools.
* Some too trivial (measure happiness with a smiley face)
* Others too complex (ask 1000 questions)

---
= data-x="4000" data-y="1000" data-scale="1"

## Create my own tool

* Called happsee(www.happsee.com)
* Works on android
* Maximize information gathered
* Minimize data entry
* Show periodic reminders

## Have been tracking happiness since October 2013

![happiness over time](images/happiness_over_time.png)

---
= data-x="6000" data-y="2000" data-scale="2"

## And here is a happiness map

Insert map here

---
= data-x="7000" data-y="0" data-scale="2"

## And moods over time...

Insert mood graph here

---
= data-x="8000" data-y="1000" data-scale="1"

## Recently, I added the ability to track a lot of passive factors

### Like call and text frequency

Insert call # graph

---
= data-x="9000" data-y="2000" data-scale="1"

## Activity

Insert activity # graph

---
= data-x="10000" data-y="2000" data-scale="2"

## And periodic location

Insert map

---
= data-x="11000" data-y="0" data-scale="1"

## What does this tell me?

---
= data-x="12000" data-y="1000" data-scale="1"

## People matter, a lot

Insert word cloud of word frequency vs happiness

---
= data-x="13000" data-y="2000" data-scale="1"

## Being tired matters more than I thought it does

Graph of tiredness vs energy as correlated to happiness

---
= data-x="14000" data-y="0" data-scale="2"

## Recovery from bad circumstances is faster than I thought

Graph of time elapsed since unhappy mood vs happy mood

---
= data-x="15000" data-y="1000" data-scale="2"

## Mood tracking is more powerful when its not mandatory

Graph of engagement with tool over time

---
= data-x="16000" data-y="1000" data-scale="2"

## Being in new circumstances makes me happy

Graph of location vs happiness

---
= data-x="17000" data-y="0" data-scale="1"

## What am I thinking for the future?

* Use machine learning to predict happiness
* Apply my own experience from the past to the future

---
= data-x="18000" data-y="0" data-scale="1"

## More future capabilities

* Allow for experience sharing and shared understanding
* Connect to the really important people around me
* Pull in data from other sources

---
= data-x="19000" data-y="1000" data-scale="2"

## Want to try it?

* In beta for android right now.
* Check out happsee.com for more information.
